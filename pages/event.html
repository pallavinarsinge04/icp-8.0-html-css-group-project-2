                    "We host grand celebrations to make everyone feel at home. We give new sarees and bangles to all the
                    women at the NGO. We also have many Ganapati idols and pujas, and take the residents, including
                    those with disabilities, to visit pandals close to our organisation. Most people here come from an
                    underprivileged background or have been abandoned. This is their chance at happiness."
                    Utsav Life, another old-age residential home in the city with hi-tech facilities, in-house medical
                    staff, chefs and several other perks, involves its golden-aged residents in the press of
                    transforming the residence into a festive home with various events.
                    "We have planned several programmes such as a dhol tasha performance for a day, aartis and special
                    festive meals for the residents. We also conduct workshops where the residents design and make d√©cor
                    items. We use these items to deck up the place. All these moments make the residents feel at home
                    with us,"
                <p>"Some old age homes are doing a good job, but many do not have activities to keep them engaged or
                    mentally healthy. In such cases, many people end up with depression, which leads to dementia. We
                    plan to conduct a survey to understand their state of mind. The state of abandoned, underprivileged
                    people is definitely better after organisations take them in," said Anjali Raje, the executive
                    director of International Longevity Centre, India, a not-for-profit organisation working for the
                    benefit of population ageing.</p>
